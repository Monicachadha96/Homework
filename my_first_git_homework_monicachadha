GIT WORKFLOW FUNDAMENTALS - seperate branch

Working Directory
The working directory is the current files/folders you are working on locally that haven’t yet been committed. They are just in checkout.
Staging Area

It is the intermediate area between a working directory and committing changes to a repository.
You can push a few different changes to the staging area at different times then when you are ready to commit them all, you can all at once from the staging area.
Local Repo (head)
This is the repo stored on your local drive, that you make changes to before committing to the remote repo
Remote repo (master)
This is the repo on github, changes from the local repo gets pushed to the master and then we can review on githib the changes.

WORKING DIRECTORY STATES:  The order of these would be modified - staged - commited
• Staged -  the area between the working directory and committing, where the files sit once the changes have been made but before they have been committed
 • Modified - These are files that have been tracked and edited since the last commit. However work in them will still be in progress and haven’t been staged yet
 • Committed -  When the changes have been confirmed and ready to be pushed to the remote repo for review

GIT COMMANDS:



Git add - this is to add a file to the staging area
Git commit - this is to commit the changes in the staging area, ready to be pushed to githib
Git push - this is to push the commit from the local repo to the remote repo (github)

Git fetch - this is to download a repo, or certain branches e.g: the homework one made for this course

Git merge - this will merge two different development files together, and any changes from those two commits.


Git pull - will update the local branch with any changes in the remote branch, and pull any new branches into the remote repo
